## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (Variables)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus more on accessibility (a11y), specifically ensuring that screen readers correctly announce the error messages when they appear dynamically. I also want to experiment with CSS Grid for more complex layouts.

### Useful resources

- [Regular Expressions (Regex) for Email Validation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46155/how-can-i-validate-an-email-address-in-javascript) - Helped me understand the pattern matching for the email input.
